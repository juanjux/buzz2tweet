When Google released Buzz I started using it, but wanted something 
to translate my posts there to Twitter, so I wrote this Django module
that using the stomp MQ would translate the (oauth authenticated) user
posts on Buzz to Twitter.

This repo is configured as a full Django installation because it has some
dependencies on other modules.

Obviously this is abandonware because Google closed Buzz but I like to keep it
for reference.
