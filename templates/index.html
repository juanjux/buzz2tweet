<strong>IMPORTANT: please don't use this. I'm closing this site soon
because there are other two webapps doing the same and I don't like triplicated 
things. You can get the same service on <a href="http://www.buzzcantweet.com/">http://www.buzzcantweet.com/</a>

<br/><br/>
This free service allows you to publish your public status updates on
Google Buzz to Twitter (all or only some with a tag.)
<br/><br/>
No registration is required, since the service settings are
controlled writing a Buzz with some special text (that you can delete after.)

<br/><br/>
To enable the service you
only need to write your public Google account login (without the password),
authorize the service with Twitter and you're ready to go!
